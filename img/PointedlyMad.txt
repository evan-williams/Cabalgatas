"Pointedly Mad" is the 20th free font from Rich Gast. 

It was originally created on 10/27/98.

Version 2.0 was completed on 8/01/99. This version both updates the
copyright information from DarkSide Productions to GreyWolf WebWorks
and makes the font embeddable.

############ EMBEDDABLE FONTS ############
NOTE: This font is coded so that it can be embedded in MS Word (.DOC)
documents. Thus, if you use this font in an MS Word document and save
the document with the font embedded, the recipient of the document will
see it with this font even though they may not have the font loaded on
their system. To embed a font in an MS Word document select "Tools"
from the MS Word menu bar and then select "Options". Under the "Save"
tab, check the box marked "Embed True Type fonts".  VOILA !
(The recipient must open the document in MS Word for this to work.)

NOTE TO PERSONAL USERS: Maybe, just maybe, you'll make a fortune using
this font in some manner. If you do, all I ask is that you remember me
with a token of your appreciation. Any modest amount (at least $1 and
not to exceed $1,000,000) would be an appropriate gesture for my
contribution to your monumental financial success. Hey! I can dream!

The character set includes:

Upper and lower case (Small Cap) letters and numbers.
The majority of punctuation and few additional characters.
Note: The keystroke ` (grave) is a special spacing element to be
used between character combinations such as "Th" to obtain whatever
desired spacing you want to achieve.

"Pointedly Mad" got its name from the fact that I started off to make
the font used on so many covers of MAD Magazine. But, as in a lot of
things I do, I took off in another direction. So instead of round
bumps on the letters, I ended up with triangular points, like the top
of my pointed little head. I've gone "pointedly mad"!

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot. If (for some unknown reason) you really
do want to make a donation to encourage me to continue my creative
efforts, send it to the address above. (Yeah....As If!) Thanks & Enjoy!
